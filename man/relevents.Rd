\description{
A time-ordered sequence of e-mail messages between employees of a 
consultancy firm and information on the actors in the relational event 
sequence. The data is orignally analyzed by Mulder & Leenders (2019), to 
find drivers of innovation-related e-mail messages exchanged between  
employees of a large consultancy firm. Originally, the data consist of 2081
e-mail messages exchanged between 70 employees over the course o fa year. 
The current data is a sample of a simulated data set, based on estimates of 
the model parameters in Mulder & Leenders (2019).

\details{
The related data files actors', 'same_building', 'same_division' and 
'same_hierarchy' contain information on the actors and three event statistics 
respectively.
